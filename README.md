# Number-plate-detection-using-edge-detection-techniques
 Utilized models such as Sobel edge detection, Otsu's approach for thresholding, bounding box to localize the  picture, segmentation models to acquire the value of each character, and number plate extraction models to  obtain the accurate number plate.
